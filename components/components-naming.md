# Components - Naming conventions
When naming your components, you should always follow these conventions.

## Use PascalCase
Use PascalCase for naming your components. This will make it easier to read and will prevent conflicts with HTML elements.

```vue
<template>
    <ExampleComponent />
</template>
```

## Use long names
Use long names for your components. This will make it easier to understand what the component is for.

>A good practice is to follow your folder structure. This will make it easier to find the component you are looking for.

Example:
```vue
<template>
    <EmployeeDetailEmploymentView />
</template>
```

## Use the component type as a suffix
Use the component type as a suffix. This will make it easier to understand what the component is for.

Example:
```vue
<template>
    <FormDropdown />
    <FormCurrencyInput />
    <FormSelectButton />
</template>
```

## Prefix with the module name
Use the folder or module name to prefix your component. This is especially useful when creating a library of components.

Example:
```vue
<template>
  <AppButton />
  <AppGrid />
  <FormDropdown />
  <FormCurrencyInput />
</template>
```
