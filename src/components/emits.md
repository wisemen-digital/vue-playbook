# Emits

Emits are the output of a component. They are used to pass data from the component to the parent.
These emits are immutable and can't be changed by the component itself.

For defining emits there are a few best practices to follow.

## Typescript constructor

Use the Typescript constructor to define your emits. This will give you the best intellisense and type checking.

```typescript
const emit = defineEmits<{
  'change': [value: Person],
}>();
```

## Prefix them when they overlap with existing events

When you have a component that emits an event that is already used by the browser, you should prefix it. This will prevent conflicts with the browser.

```typescript
const emit = defineEmits<{
  click: [value: Person],
  itemSelect: [value: Person],
}>()
```

## Use verbs

Use verbs to name your emits. This will make it clear what the emit is for.

```typescript
const emit = defineEmits<{
  change: [value: Person],
  click: [value: Person],
}>()
```

## Handling emits in the parent

When handling emits in the parent, you should always use the `on` prefix.

This will make it clear that you are handling an emit.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
  
async function deletePerson(value: Person): Promise<void> {
  // handle the delete
  try {
    await deletePersonMutation.execute(value);
  } catch {
    // handle the error
  }
}
  
function onRowClick(value: Person): void {
  // handle the row click
  deletePerson(value);
}  
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <FormSelect @item-select="onSelectChange" />
    <EmployeeTable @row-click="onRowClick" />
  </div>
</template>
```
